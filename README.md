# ASPCore.Angular.HighCharts
In this article, we will be creating an online poll application using ASP.NET Core, Angular 5 and Entity Framework core. Since this is the season of IPL in India, we will create an online poll for “Who is going to win IPL 2018”. The poll results will be displayed as a column chart, that is created using Highcharts.

We will use Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2014.
